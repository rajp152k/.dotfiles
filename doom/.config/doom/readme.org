#+title: Doom Configs

* Abstract
 - My doom configs

* Overall structure

** init.el
 - doom flags for defaults that ship with the flavour
** package.el
 - custom/esoteric packages that don't ship with the flavour
** config.el
 - controlling the configs of the packages
 - would like to structure these better
   - also has some unstructured keybinds
   - also has a bunch of misc functions

** gptel-config.el
 - prompts, models, configs for the gptel package

** secret.el
 - API keys, personal info vars, etc for convenient use

* Future Plans
** literacy vs hard core code
 - see if I  want to go the "tangle and weave" a single org file
 - or manually manage a bunch of diff files
 - I won't be going vanilla again but doom could use some customizations

* Handy defaults I'd like to remember exist
** shell-stuff
 - execute sync : M-!
 - execute async : M-&
 - evil shell command on region : !
 - execute on region :- M-|
 - eshell popup / in buffer : spc o e / E
 - vterm popup / in buffer : spc o t / T
