description: Define scope and success criteria before starting a task
agent: plan

Help me scope the following task: $ARGUMENTS

Walk me through:
1. **Intent**: What am I actually trying to achieve? (not what I said, but what I mean)
2. **Boundaries**: What's explicitly in scope? What's out?
3. **Done criteria**: What does "finished" look like? Be specific.
4. **Time box**: How long should this take? When should I stop and reassess?
5. **Blockers/Risks**: What might derail this? What do I need before starting?

Keep it tight. This is a 2-minute exercise, not a planning document.
