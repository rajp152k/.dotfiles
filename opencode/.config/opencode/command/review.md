description: Review progress on open goals
agent: plan

Review my current open goals and progress:

1. Run `gh issue list` to see all open issues
2. For each issue, assess:
   - Is the deadline still realistic?
   - What's blocking progress?
   - What's the next concrete action?
3. Suggest which issue to focus on next based on urgency and dependencies
4. Identify any issues that should be closed or updated
