Help me make a decision about: $ARGUMENTS

Follow the decision-making protocol:
1. Clarify the decision to be made
2. List options with pros/cons
3. Identify key criteria for evaluation
4. Make a recommendation with reasoning
5. If this warrants documentation, suggest creating a decision file in `decisions/YYMMDD-topic.org`
